I think we need to make separate files for codes in a markdown files and readme with the description.
Code on part 1 seems fine but make sure you give the direction for your files in the Rmarkdown file itself. 
I see some of the coding is in progress for part 2. 
Please do not forget about the output files, all 40 of them. 
Good luck.
